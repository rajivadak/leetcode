Algorithms

Divided in two sections:

Algorithms:
1. Design - writing code/design in statements and notes format. 
Those who have domain knowledge they wil make the design.
Any language can be used until its understanble by the team
It us H/W-S/W independent.
Analyze the algorithm to check is it is efficient and achieving the target purpose.

Program:
1. Implementation - converting the design to code
Programmer will write the code
This is written using only programming language
It is dependent on the H/W & OS used
Testing is required to confirm the proper working.

---------------------------------------------------------

Priori Analysis: We can equate to algorithm section as stated above. Added feature in this is the inclusion of time-space function.

Posterion Testing: We can equate it to program as stated above. Added feature in this is the inclusion of watch-time and bytes.

Info:
time-space function- 
watch-time & bytes- 

---------------------------------------------------------

Charachteristic of algorithm:

1. Input - can/should take 0 or more input
2. Output - atleast 1 output
3. Definiteness - should be non-ambiguous
4. Finiteness - duration of program should be finite
5. Effectiveness - avoid unnecessary statements and procedures

---------------------------------------------------------

How to write an Algorithm:

Any syntax can be used, but it should be understanble by all team.

criterion to consider while writing an Algorithm:
1. Time 
2. Space
3. N/W consumption and channel method
4. Power consumption
5. Number of CPU registers being consumed
